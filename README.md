# Joint Universities Accelerator School: Accelerator Design Workshop

The [JUAS](https://www.esi-archamps.eu/juas-presentation/) features an [accelerator design workshop](https://esi-archamps.eu/juas-courses/#1636455686368-8e28251f-fd39). This repository provides the lattice design jupyter notebook, which contains the setup and exercises to design a particle collider using the [xsuite](https://xsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) simulation framework.
